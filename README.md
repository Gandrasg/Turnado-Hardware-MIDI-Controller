# Turnado Hardware MIDI Controller

This project is the development of a dedicated hardware MIDI controller for [Turnado](https://sugar-bytes.de/turnado) - a multi-award winning, real-time multi audio effect software plugin, developed by Berlin-based company Sugar Bytes. 

This is an ongoing project being developed for the Musical Instrument Challenge of the 2018 Hackaday Prize - see the project page [here](https://hackaday.io/project/160792-turnado-hardware-midi-controller).


This repo includes all code and design files for the project.

The project uses a [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontoller, and requries the following software and libraries to compile the code:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) software add-on for Arduino IDE
- [Optimized ILI9341 TFT Library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/ILI9341_t3) for Arduino
